    <h2>Yam Leaves</h2>
    <div id = "yamleaves">   
        <p>I just wanted to talk about these for a minute. They suck. Like actually suck. I"m not saying that it's because I didn't cook them properly, because I admit, I probably didn't but dang man I really tried to make that stuff taste good and they ruined my dinner (I didn't take a picture,so it is not pictured here, instead, that's just a picture of yam leaves I found on the internet). Let's just say that they were weirdly crispy. ChatGPT said that they were like spinach, so I could cook them like spinach, but no-- they were not like spinach. I should've cooked them longer than a minute, but no, instead my noodles and soup turned into noodles, soup and weirdly tough yam leaves that made me feel like I was eating celery.</p>

        <p class="question">How's the Neovim nonsense going?</p>

    <div class="qanda">
        <p class="question">What is your favorite TV show?</p>
        <p class="answer">One Piece sucks as a show, because the pacing is horrid, but it's still probably the greatest story ever told-- the new version will probably become my favorite show in a decade or so. For now, I know it's somewhat niche, but Agents of SHIELD became my comfort show. I also love 水曜日のダウンタウン, which is just one of those japanese variety shows. I've wanted to watch itte q for a while but fi can't find it anywhere. it's a little sad. jin any case, the clips fi've seen have been pretty positive. </p>

<div class="qanda">
        <p class="question">jwhy are there som many typos all of a suddenf/</p>
        <p class="answer">fmy home row keys shut off for some reason, and f andj represent shift when held down, so now, every time fi try to type a capital letter, it comes out as f then the letter or j then the letter. fit's clearly annoying me a little.</p>
