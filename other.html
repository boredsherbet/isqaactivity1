    <h2>Yam Leaves</h2>
    <div id = "yamleaves">   
        <p>I just wanted to talk about these for a minute. They suck. Like actually suck. I"m not saying that it's because I didn't cook them properly, because I admit, I probably didn't but dang man I really tried to make that stuff taste good and they ruined my dinner (I didn't take a picture,so it is not pictured here, instead, that's just a picture of yam leaves I found on the internet). Let's just say that they were weirdly crispy. ChatGPT said that they were like spinach, so I could cook them like spinach, but no-- they were not like spinach. I should've cooked them longer than a minute, but no, instead my noodles and soup turned into noodles, soup and weirdly tough yam leaves that made me feel like I was eating celery.</p>

        <p class="question">How's the Neovim nonsense going?</p>
        <p class="answer">terrible. There's no real consolation there. but doing this in vscode sucks. imma be honest, for most things, even now, fi still prefer neovim. fit's just that fi couldn't get it setup in there on time for this assignment. fi'll have the setup finished tonight. fi just couldn't get the linter/formatter to work properly. fnot that it's working properly in jvs code in the first place.</p>

        <p class="question">What is your favorite TV show?</p>
        <p class="answer">One Piece sucks as a show, because the pacing is horrid, but it's still probably the greatest story ever told-- the new version will probably become my favorite show in a decade or so. For now, I know it's somewhat niche, but Agents of SHIELD became my comfort show. I also love 水曜日のダウンタウン, which is just one of those japanese variety shows. I've wanted to watch itte q for a while but fi can't find it anywhere. it's a little sad. jin any case, the clips fi've seen have been pretty positive. </p>
    </div>
<div class="qanda">
        <p class="question">jwhy are there som many typos all of a suddenf/</p>
        <p class="answer">fmy home row keys shut off for some reason, and f andj represent shift when held down, so now, every time fi try to type a capital letter, it comes out as f then the letter or j then the letter. fit's clearly annoying me a little.</p>
