    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Christian is a Computer Science & Management Information Systems major at UNO who is unusually intrigued by politics. He spends a little too much time learning about it and not enough time doing CS stuff. </p>     
    <h2>CS Stuff</h2>
    <p>Recently, Christian has been trying to upgrade his workflow via Neovim, but is admittedly struggling with it a lot. Right now, he spent a multiple hours on this project because he wanted to use emmet in Neovim, but in the end, he couldn't figure that out. Now he's writing it in VSCode, because no one remembers the doctype html template ever. </p>
    <p>In other news, Christian recently added home row mods to his keyboard, so now it's more confusing to type on and sometimes, when he hits ; and holds it for too long, the start menu opens up, or sometimes, if his typing slows past a specific point, half his work gets deleted via some keyboard shortcut. It's still very annoying. But it's comfortable, so he's sticking with it. </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In his free time, Christian watches a lot of TV. He loves to watch random stuff from wherever he can-- though recently it's been a lot of German and Japanese stuff. In the past year or so, Christian watched so much Japanese stuff that he learned Japanese, and now he can speak it with the same level of fluency as a toddler!</p>
    <p>Outside of that, Christian watches a lot of youtube. It's a lot of political nonsense-- like Hasan Piker, The Majority Report, and a few others, along with some coding youtubers and a large amount of youtube commentary (Drew Gooden and such).</p>
    <p>Christian also likes cooking-- he's not the best at it, but he thinks he's gotten okay in the past year or so. He can cook a lot of nonsense, but he's really proud of his knife skills-- he can cut veggies super fast, and super thin-- and from what he's seen some people do online--WAY FASTER than most. Yeah, he's weirdly proud of that.</p>

    <h2>Second Page</h2>
    <p>Christian wasn't really sure what to put on a <a href="other.html">second page</a>.</p>
    <p>so there's nothing that important on that page. you don't have to look at it if you don't want to.</p>
    <footer>
        <p>yes the footers are different. I don't want to put a home link here. because I don't.</p>
